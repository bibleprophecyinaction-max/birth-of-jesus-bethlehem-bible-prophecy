# Birth of the Lord Jesus – Good Tidings of Great Joy

Two thousand years ago in Bethlehem, the most glorious event in human history took place — God came down to earth in human flesh.

## Fulfilled Prophecy

Though Caesar Augustus issued a decree for a census, it was ultimately God's divine plan being fulfilled. The prophet Micah had foretold centuries earlier:

“But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah… out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.” (Micah 5:2)

Through this decree, Joseph and Mary traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born.

## The Humble Birth

“And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger…” (Luke 2:7)

There was no room in the inn — yet heaven itself rejoiced.

## The Angelic Announcement

To shepherds in the fields, an angel proclaimed:

“Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy… For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10–11)

A multitude of the heavenly host declared:

“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men.”

## The Purpose of His Birth

Jesus Christ came to:
- Save humanity from sin
- Fulfill divine prophecy
- Reveal the love of God
- Die and rise again for our salvation

The cross was the ultimate expression of God's redeeming love.

The risen Savior declared that repentance and forgiveness of sins would be preached in His name to all nations.

## A Personal Invitation

Have you repented of your sins?
Have you received assurance of salvation?

Come to the Savior and experience His redeeming grace.
